          The Indian Students Association plays a pivotal role in helping newly
          arrived students settle in Blacksburg. Our organization conducts a
          series of informative sessions and webinars throughout the summer to
          offer comprehensive guidance on a variety of topics including housing,
          finance, banking, health, travel and more. Moreover, we provide
          extensive resources and documents that provide detailed explanations
          and guides on all the important information required for a smooth
          settlement in Blacksburg.
