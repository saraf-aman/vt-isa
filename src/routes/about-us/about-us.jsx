        <p>
          The Virginia Tech-based Indian Students Association (ISA) serves as a
          platform for commemorating India's diverse culture and heritage while
          aiding new students in adapting to the American lifestyle. With more
          than 800 engaged members, encompassing students and their families,
          ISA constitutes the most extensive global community on the Virginia
          Tech campus. As a strictly non-profit and non-partisan organization,
          our primary goal is to foster a sense of cultural exchange and mutual
          respect.

          ISA's array of social events is a vibrant celebration of the diverse
          cultural tapestry and artistic heritage of the Indian subcontinent. We
          curate a range of festivals, including Diwali, Dandiya-Raas, Holi,
          Independence Day, and Republic Day, showcasing talented artists from
          our community. These festivities provide a platform for raising
          awareness on topics from regional cuisine to prevalent social issues
          in India. We encourage community participation through volunteer
          activities like the Aruna Run, International Cafe Hours, and
          exhibitions at the International Street Fair. Notably, the inaugural
          Aruna Run at Virginia Tech garnered around $6000 to combat sexual
          exploitation of women in rural India.

          ISA functions as a comprehensive network for educational, social, and
          professional mentoring and support for Indian students studying at
          Virginia Tech. From the outset of their tenure, we provide new
          students guidance and assistance through live chat sessions, airport
          pickups, and advice on practical matters such as banking, healthcare,
          and off-campus housing. We foster connections amongst students by
          introducing them to peers within the community, thereby expanding
          their network of familiar faces in Blacksburg.
